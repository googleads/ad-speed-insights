# Reduce ad density

## Overview

This audit ensures that ads take up no more than 30% of the page vertically. On
mobile, we check the density of all ads on the page together. On desktop we
measure ad density on each column separately and check that no column exceeds
the recommended threshold. An ad density greater than 30% has been found to
negatively impact user experience[^1].

## Recommendations

Depending on the situation, slots should either be spaced farther apart or have
a reduced size.
