# Publisher Ads Audits for Lighthouse (Alpha)

Publisher Ads Audits for Lighthouse is a tool to improve ad speed and overall quality through a series of automated audits. At the moment, this is primarily targeted at sites using Google Ad Manager. This tool will aid in resolving discovered problems, providing a tool to be used to evaluate effectiveness of iterative changes while suggesting actionable feedback.
